# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews. The project classifies reviews as either **positive** or **negative** using a Naive Bayes model.

## UML Diagram
The following diagram outlines the key steps in the machine learning pipeline:

## Main Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Converts reviews into a format suitable for model training by applying tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Model:** Naive Bayes classifier trained with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation:** Model evaluated on small and large datasets, achieving an accuracy of over 84%.
- **Prediction:** Predicts sentiment for new movie reviews.

## Setup and Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow these instructions to set up and run the sentiment analysis project.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your local machine.
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Danielkis97/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews-Using-Machine-Learning.git
    cd Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews-Using-Machine-Learning
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt


 4. **Download the dataset:**
   The dataset used for this project is the **IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset**. Download it from [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). After downloading, extract it into the project directory where you've placed the other NLP project files. The resulting directory structure should look like this:

```plaintext
project_directory/
â”œâ”€â”€ train_model.py
â”œâ”€â”€ predict_sentiment.py
â”œâ”€â”€ data_preprocessing.py
â”œâ”€â”€ load_data_big.py
â”œâ”€â”€ load_data_small.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aclImdb/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pos/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ neg/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pos/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ neg/

```

5. **Load the Data:** Before training the model, you need to load the dataset. Run one of the following commands depending on whether you want to train with a large or small dataset:

```sh
    python load_data_big.py  # For large dataset
    python load_data_small.py  # For small dataset
```

6. **Train the Model: To train the model, run:**
    ```sh
     python train_model.py
   ```
7. **Predict Sentiment: To predict the sentiment of a new review, run:**
    ```sh
        python predict_sentiment.py
   ```

- **load_data_big.py:** Script for loading the large dataset of movie reviews.
- **load_data_small.py:** Script for loading the small dataset of movie reviews.
- **latest_model.pkl:** Trained Naive Bayes model.
- **latest_vectorizer.pkl:** Vectorizer for transforming text into numerical features.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- **RESULTS.md:** File containing detailed evaluation results for small and large datasets.


## Possible Bugs and Solutions

- **Data Loading Errors:**
  - **Scenario:** Issues with loading data or incorrect paths.
  - **Solution:** Ensure the dataset is in the correct directory and paths are correctly specified in the scripts.

- **Model Performance Issues:**
  - **Scenario:** Lower-than-expected accuracy or incorrect predictions.
  - **Solution:** Check data preprocessing steps and consider experimenting with different models or hyperparameters.
 
## Evaluation Results
Detailed evaluation results, including confusion matrices and performance metrics for both small and large datasets, can be found in the [Evaluation Results](RESULTS.md)

## Development Environment

The code for this project was developed using PyCharm, which offers a powerful IDE for Python development.
